     Capital One‚Äôs Software Engineering Summit culminated in a hackathon where we were tasked with create something using
     <a href="http://api.reimaginebanking.com/">
      Nessie
     </a>
     , Capital One‚Äôs hackathon API that emulates banking data. Our idea developed from problems we have ourselves faced in the past. Planning trips with friends can be a chore, especially with the finances; no one wants to be the one organizing everything. Creating a system where the finances surrounding a trip or event become centralized would greatly simplify planning.

     Functionality
    </h2>
    <p>
     The core functionality for our idea was a central API that would keep a track of all relevant data for all events, such as planned date, expected cost, and current contribution amount. This allows (in theory) for compatibility and synchronization across many devices and platforms, though we were only able to implement two in practice.
    </p>
    <h3 id="api">
     API
    </h3>
    <p>
     The API extends Nessie with several new features, such as user logins, centralizing a third party account for travel funds, and issuing refunds. It was written using Flask-RESTful and is hosted by Heroku.
    </p>
    <h3 id="messenger-bot">
     Messenger Bot
    </h3>
    <p>
     Every API feature was ported to a Messenger Bot, so a user can login and check his status simply through sending a message. Natural language processing recognizes different ways of writing statements with the same intent i.e. ‚ÄúHow much money have we saved?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow much we got?‚Äù will both cause the bot to respond with the current progress.
    </p>
    <h3 id="android-app">
     Android App
    </h3>
    <p>
     The API was also ported to Android, where a user can visualize all his planned events as well as view charts on group member contributions, adding a layer of accountability. Certain features, however, were not able to be ported in time, such as logins.

     This was my first hackathon, even though it wasn‚Äôt a big one. I learned a lot about programming in a team setting. We faced several challenges, especially with Android SDK; one person‚Äôs computer kept crashing every time the app was built, HTTP requests took significantly more time to implement in Java, and merge conflicts were horrible with our inexperience with Android Studio. But overall, it was a good introduction for partner programming classes and future hackathons.
