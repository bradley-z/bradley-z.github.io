     Hi there! I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. Specifically, I have academic interests in systems programming, autonomous driving, and quantitative finance. I will also be serving as a TA for CS 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems this Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last summer, I did research at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in parallel computing, machine learning, and their applications to high performance computational studies. I also attended Capital One's Software Engineering Summit at the end of the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next summer, I will be working on core systems development as a software engineering intern at <a href="http://www.transmarketgroup.com/">TransMarket Group</a>, a quantitative proprietary trading firm in Chicago West Loop.
    </p>
    <p>
     I began working on this site towards the end of June 2018. In addition to being a host for my professional portfolio, this project was also meant to also serve as a collection of my thoughts and to track personal change and growth throughout the rest of college and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feel free to contact me at <a href = "mailto: bradley.m.zhou@gmail.com">bradley.m.zhou@gmail.com</a> for anything!
